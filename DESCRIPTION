Description: Performs partial principal component analysis of a large sparse matrix. 
  The matrix may be stored as a list of matrices to be concatenated (implicitly) horizontally.
  Useful application includes cases where the number of total nonzero entries exceed the capacity of 
  32 bit integers (e.g., with large SNP data).
